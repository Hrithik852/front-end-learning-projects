## Project 5: Countdown Timer ⏱️
This project is a perfect introduction to setInterval, as it involves updating the screen at a regular interval.

What i'll build: A digital timer that counts down from a specific number (e.g., 10) to 0. When it reaches 0, it displays a message like "Liftoff! 🚀".

Goals:

Use setInterval to run a function every 1 second (1000 milliseconds).

Inside the function, decrease a counter variable and update the text on the screen.

When the counter reaches 0, use clearInterval to stop the interval and prevent it from running forever.

Display a final message once the timer stops.
