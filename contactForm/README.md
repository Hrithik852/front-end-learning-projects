## Project 1: The Classic Contact Form 📝

What i'll build: A simple form with fields for a Name, Email, and a Message.

Validation goals:

Name: Check that the field is not empty.

Email: Check that the field is not empty and that the input is in a valid email format (e.g., name@domain.com).

Message: Check that it's not empty and has a minimum length (e.g., at least 10 characters).
